# Assignment 3:  Interactive Exploration of NBA Shot Logs

This repo contains a Shiny Web Application created in R for viewing and tinkering with different relationships between variables in the NBA 2014-2015 Season Shot Logs.  Code is separated into two files,  the [User Interface](https://github.com/sullivannicole/dataviz/blob/master/submissions/sullivan_nicole/Assignment3/NBA_2015_Shots/ui.R) and the [Server](https://github.com/sullivannicole/dataviz/blob/master/submissions/sullivan_nicole/Assignment3/NBA_2015_Shots/server.R), both of which access data from a [tidied dataframe](https://github.com/sullivannicole/dataviz/blob/master/submissions/sullivan_nicole/Assignment3/NBA_2015_Shots/NBA.csv) located in the same folder.  The app can be run locally in RStudio - or one can simply check out the [real deal online](https://sullivan.shinyapps.io/nba_2014-2015_shots/).
