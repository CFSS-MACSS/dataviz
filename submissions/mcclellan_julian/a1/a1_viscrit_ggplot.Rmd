# Part 1: Visualization critique (5 points)

I will be critiquing the visualization below from the subreddit /r/changemyview:

![](https://i.redd.it/20mghgkfwppy.png)

This visualization originally appeared in the submission titled: [[OC] Heatmap of the most pixels changes happend on r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/63kuy6/oc_heatmap_of_the_most_pixels_changes_happend_on/?utm_content=title&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=dataisbeautiful).

For those who aren"t familiar, /r/place displayed a 1000x1000 pixel canvas where
individual Reddit accounts (made before 3/31/17) could change the color of one 
pixel to one of 16 colors every 10 minutes. Changes were allowed for 72 hours and
then halted. More information is available
[here](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/events/rplace).

## Truthful

The truthfullness of this visualization is somewhat difficult to verify 
independently or quickly From the OP:  

> I"ve used python with pandas to create heatmap via matplotlib, using crawled 
data from r/PlaceDevs"

The OP doesn"t provide the raw data, and while presumably one can also scrape the
information from r/PlaceDevs with some scrapers people in the community have made, 
one can hack together a rough verification by viewing 
[a timelapse of /r/place](https://youtu.be/jWzjyL4yAe4). Looking at this video,
there doesn"t seem to be any aggregious area where high or low pixel change 
activity has been hidden in the original heatmap.

## Functional

As one can glean from the title of the post, the visuzalization is simply trying
to show where the most pixel changes occurred over the 72 hour creation period. 
On an intuitive level at least, it accomplishes this, as one can quickly identify
areas of "high chage" (white, orange) and "low(er) change" (dark red, black). 

However, in other respects, this visualization is less functional. While color 
serves to differentiate pixel change, a legend mapping color to the exact level
of change is never revealed.

In my opinion, failing to communicate the quantity of change in the heatmap is 
the visualization"s biggest flaw. One might argue that the choice of time period
for the change metric is arbitrary, and thus uncessary in the first place. However,
given the collaborative nature of /r/place, and that a single Redditor could 
only change one pixel every 10 minutes, a measure of pixel change: "average 
changes every 10 minutes" can communicate the average level of change during the
downtime of any lone Redditor.

Further functionality could also be added to a legend by marking the specific 
color that defines the canvas wide level of change, giving the viewer notions of
above and below average levels of pixel change.

## Beautiful 

If I were back in my Art 101 class, I would argue that this data visualization is
beautiful. The very fact that high levels of pixel change are uniquely clustered
introduces a nice contrast of negative (black) and positive (red to white) space. 
This visaulization has a more aesthetically pleasing level of contrast (and color 
pallete) than the one [this Redditor made.](https://i.imgur.com/4awiJnV.png)

Additionally, the visualization"s lack of legend and labelling in general seems
to be in line with a sort of minimalism trend that is present on many original 
submissions in /r/changemyview.

According to one Redditor, the visualization also hits upon a "Matrix" vibe, 
prompting the creation of:

![matrix version.](https://i.imgur.com/iSB348l.jpg)
So then, the visualization seems to compare to other similar visualizations and
inspires alteration. For my purposes, it is beautiful.

## Insightful

The visualization does not seem to be drawing attention to any particular area, 
so it seems to be devoid of any "a-ha" insights.  

Even so, a measured inspection of the visualization shows us a number of areas 
in the canvas have identifiable designs and high numbers of pixel change, 
indicating that these designs had to contend with a degree of vandalism. (If 
the designs each other one would expect individual deisngs to be less 
identifiable/obfuscated with other designs.)

In particular, a viwer might notice that the American Flag (center) and the hammer
and sickle (center-left) were both subject to high levels of pixel change from 
this heatmap.

So then, the visualization does offer some insight into "controversial" designs
of sorts, but there are many more areas of the canvas in which it is difficult or
impossible to identify the design. One could watch the 
[timelapse](https://youtu.be/jWzjyL4yAe4) that was mentioned earlier, but the 
visualization could also be overlayed with the final (cleaned) /r/place canvas
to offer more insight to a reader.

With this addition, the visualization still offers the controversial designs insight, 
but one can now see that in many cases, designs that featured faces of some 
sort, had high levels of pixel change around the eyes and mouth. Other country flags
besides the U.S. also seem to be areas subject to high levels of pixel change 
activity.

## Enlightening

The visualization does some *good* with the data. It doesn"t necessarily do any
offer viewers any social insight, but it offers an enlightening look into the 
process of collaborative art.  

/r/place did not invent collaborative art or digital collaborative art, but 
unlike most collaborative art /r/place features both collaboration *and* 
competition where Redditors can both create and/or destroy. I would think that 
most viewers can internalize the notion of collobaration in a work of art, but 
a simultaneously competitive and collaborative process might be more alien. 

By mapping levels of pixel change to color the visualization offers a one image 
summary of the opposed creative and destructive processes that took place during
the creation of the canvas. It offers obvious patterns and cryptic ones that 
entice viewers to investigate the final canvas, and the process by which it was
created.

# Part 2: `ggplot2` and the grammar of graphics (10 points)

```{r}
biden_df <- read_csv("../data/biden.csv") %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  mutate(female = factor(female),
    party = 2 * dem + rep,
    party = ifelse(party == 2, "dem", 
                   ifelse(party == 1, "rep", "ind")),
    age_quant = cut(age, quantile(age), include.lowest = TRUE),
    educ_quant = cut(educ, quantile(educ, seq(0, 1, .5)), include.lowest = TRUE,
                     labels = c('0 to 13 years of education', '14 to 17+ years of education')))

biden_df %>%
  ggplot(aes(female, biden, fill = party)) +
    geom_violin() +
    facet_grid(educ_quant ~ age_quant) +
    labs()
