# Age and Support for Democracy. 

## Literature review
Several authors have explore the importance of peoples’ support for democracy. This mass support is base on peoples’ perception about the fairness of the democratic system. (Seligson:2009, GRAHAM:2004wq) Notions about the factors impacting peoples’ support for democracy go from institutional performance on satisfaction with democracy, accountability, income distribution, living standards, etc. (Castillo:2006wg) For this exercise, I hypothesize there is a connection between individuals’ support for democracy and age in the context of Latin Americans.  

## Methods 
The data used for this assignment was extracted from [http://www.latinobarometro.org/lat.jsp]. It is a survey data base with 205850 observations and 339 features. Several authors have supported the measurement of support for democracy through surveys {GRAHAM:2004wq}

To begin the analysis, the data was accessed, cleaned, recoded, and tidied. 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
tidy_data <- read_csv("data/tidy_data/tidy_data.csv")

```

## Exploratory Analysis
 
An exploratory analysis was conducted to find potential patters and effects of independent variables on the dependent variable, support for democracy.

The first connection I explored was the effect of gender on satisfaction with democracy. The graph shows a balance satisfaction with democracy independent of gender. In other words, males and females tend to be satisfied with democracy equally.

Another connection that I wanted to explore was between social class, marital status, and satisfaction with democracy. Interestingly, there is an emphasis in the satisfaction with democracy among individuals who are married or are engaged in a partner relationship. It is possible that people in this group are more mature an planning to establishing a family. Thus, they are more concern about the stability of the country than individuals who are separated or single. Similarly, it seem that, in general, individuals in that self-identified as middle class are more satisfied with democracy.

In the case of the connection between satisfaction with democracy and perception of the country economic performance, individuals who consider the economy be above average, tend to be more satisfied with democracy than those who though the economy was performing badly, or well.

Finally, I explored the effect of age on individuals' satisfaction with democracy. I notice something interesting. That independently of the age group, the distribution of individuals among levels of satisfaction with democracy, seems to be evenly distributed. Thus, I decided to explore this effect implementing a logistic regression model. 


## Models

Because satisfaction with democracy represented a categorical variable, a liner model was not adequate. In this case, I run a logistic regression model in order to estimate, given the predicted probability, that an individual would be satisfied or not with democracy.

The graph of the model shows that as individuals age they tend to be more satisfied with democracy. Following, I to visualize the predictions from the model, I generating an evenly spaced grid of values covering the region where our data lies and then, I generated plain probability predictions about the satisfaction with democracy depending on age.

The above graph is the ploted logistic regression line using the estimated model. As it can be notices, the prediction fit very well the old model values. 


### Testing the accuracy of the model. 

The next step, was to evaluate how accurate was the model predicting satisfaction with democracy based on age. With this purpose I conducted a train-test set validation. the data was split into a train-set with 70 percent of the data and a test-set with 30 percent. after training the model and conducting the test, the validation indicated that  77% of the test set observations were accurately predicted. 

## Conclusion

After conducting this analysis it is clear that age is an important predictor of satisfaction with democracy. This can be related to several factors. For example, it is well established that as people age, they tend to be more satisfied in general with life, focusing in the little aspects of life and avoiding ideological extremism. On the other hand, the effect can be the result of the transformation of the variable. Du to the lack of time, I was force to recode a four levels satisfaction with democracy variable into a two levels in order to speed up the process of building the model in R. Nevertheless, this arbitrary recoding could have affected the final results, inflating the effect of age on levels of satisfaction with democracy.
