# Student assignment submissions

Students should submit assignments in this folder. Submission steps include:

1. Fork the course repo.
1. Create a folder inside this directory for all your submissions. Label this folder using the `LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME` format, such as `soltoff_benjamin/`.
1. Create a folder for each assignment.
1. Complete your work on the assignment in that folder, storing all necessary data files, code, output, graphics, etc. Include everything necessary to reproduce your work.
    * Be sure to commit your work **early and often**.
1. Push your commits back up to your fork on GitHub.
1. Open a pull request on the master repo (this one). Include your name in the title and in the PR description include a brief reflection on the assignment (what was easy, what was difficult, what outside resources did you use, etc.).

Assignments are due prior to the start of class on the assigned due date. Late submissions will be heavily frowned upon :frowning:
