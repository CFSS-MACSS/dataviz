Is it truthful?
------
The data is sourced from OnTheIssues.org, which utilizes direct quotes from political figures to ascertain their views on social and economic issues. Truthfulness is relatively high for this visualization, as the year from which the first time point of data stems from is notated for each politician profiled. This offers an accountable and transparent narrative of the data that allows for a more nuanced comparsion to be made among points. However, one point in which truthfulness is less than ideal is that the labels of "populism" and "libertarianism" are somewhat obscured by two things: the subjective nature of OnTheIssues.org's assessments of these rankings, and the fact that these words are operationalized on the chart as representing more academic political concepts as opposed to layperson usage. So while the chart attempts to draw forward the narrative that Donald Trump has gotten increasingly less populistic, the associated article on [the Five Thirty Eight website](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/sorry-bloomberg-trump-is-already-a-third-party-candidate/) instead conceptualizes populism as being espoused by collectivist economic ideas such as an increased tax on the most wealthy as opposed to the more social and cultural populism espoused by Trump on the campaign trail. When crucial axes of the graph are rendered obscure by language with a more academic and less inuitive connotation, it is harder for viewers to grasp the facts and ideas at play.
