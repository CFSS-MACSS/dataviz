## Course description

Social scientists frequently wish to convey information to a broader audience in a cohesive and interpretable manner. Visualizations are an excellent method to summarize information and report analysis and conclusions in a compelling format. This course introduces the theory and applications of data visualization. Students will learn about theory of cognition and perception in order to understand how humans process and synthesize information in a visual medium, while also developing techniques and methods for generating rich, informative, and interactive visualizations for both data exploration and explanation. These techniques will be developed using software implementations in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/).

### Prerequisites

Students are expected to have prior programming experience; this is not an introductory programming course and students without this experience will have significant difficulties keeping up with the material. Experience could come from completion of [MACS 30500 - Computing for the Social Sciences](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/), an alternative course on programming at UChicago or undergrad, or self-taught experience using either R or Python. Students should also be familiar with the [Git version tracking system](https://git-scm.com/) and be comfortable with the Git workflow (commit, push, pull, merge, etc.). Finally, some basic experience with probability/statistical theory (especially regression analysis) will be helpful, though not required.

## Disability services

If you need any special accommodations, please provide us with a copy of your Accommodation Determination Letter (provided to you by the Student Disability Services office) as soon as possible so that you may discuss with me how your accommodations may be implemented in this course.

## Readings

Readings for the course will come primarily from the following books, as well as an assortment of journal articles:

* **TA** - Cairo, Alberto. *The Truthful Art: Data, charts, and maps for communication*. New Riders, 2016.
* **FA** - Cairo, Alberto. *The Functional Art: An introduction to information graphics and visualization*. New Riders, 2012.
* **D3** - [Murray, Scott. *Interactive data visualization for the Web*. O'Reilly Media, Inc., 2013.](http://alignedleft.com/work/d3-book)
* **R4DS** - [Wickham, Hadley and Garrett Grolemund. *R for Data Science*. O'Rielly Media, Inc., 2017.](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)

You are expected to purchase a copy of TA; R4DS and D3 are both available for free online, however you can also purchase a hard-copy if you prefer that medium. I have submitted a purchase request to the UChicago library to obtain an ebook copy of TA and FA, however I do not know if/when these will be obtained. We will only use a few chapters from FA, so you may be able to get by with requesting just the required chapters via interlibrary loan.
