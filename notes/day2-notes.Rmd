# Objectives

* Define data structures

# Basic data structures

Before determining the type of visualization to draw, one must first consider the type of data and information to visualize.^[Munzner Ch 2] First we identify major types of **data**, then identify how they can be combined to generate a **dataset**.

## Data types

There are five major types of data:

1. **Attribute** - some specific property that can be measured, observed, or logged
    * Also known as a **variable** or **dimension**
1. **Item** - an individual entity that is discrete, such as a row in a table or a node in a network
    * Can think of this as the **unit of analysis** - what is being measured?
1. **Link** - a relationship between items, typically within a network
1. **Grid** - specifies the strategy for sampling continuous data in terms of both geometric and topological relationships between cells
1. **Position** - spatial data identifying location in two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) space

## Dataset types

Different types of **datasets** will contain different types of **data**.

### Tables

**Tables** are the standard dataset type in social science. They resemble spreadsheets, and store data in either a **flat** or **multidimensional** table.

A **flat table** stores data in rows and columns.

* Each row is an item
* Each column is an attribute
* Each cell is a value fully specified by the combination of row and column

A **multidimensional table** uses multiple keys to uniquely identify each item. For example, longitudinal data (repeated observations of items) may still be stored in a flat table but use two columns (attributes) to uniquely identify each item. Alternatively, data can be stored in a multidimensional array that preserves the multidimensional structure.

### Networks

**Networks** are used to specify relationships between two or more items.

* **Item** $\equiv$ **Node**
    * Also known as a **vertex**
* **Link** - relationship between nodes
    * Also known as an **edge**
* Nodes can have associated attributes
* Links can also (independently) have attributes

#### Trees

A **tree** is a network with a hierarchical structure - each child node has only one parent node pointing to it.

### Fields

**Fields** contain attribute values associated with cells. **Cells** contain measurements or calculations from a **continuous** domain: theoretically there are an infinite number of values you could measure, so you select a discrete interval from which to sample.

For instance, measuring climate change is serious stuff. In order to accurately measure climate change, where do you place your measurement stations?

* Pavement artificially increases the measured temperature on the surface of the Earth, so you cannot place the station too close to paved surfaces
* Urban regions generate more man-made heat, so stations located near urban regions should report warmer temperatures than rural regions
* Data collection methods in developing countries could be unreliable, so should we trust those measurements?

### Geometry

**Geometry** datasets specify information about the shape of items with explicit spatial positions. These could be maps, but also include any item like points, one-dimensional lines and curves, two-dimensional surfaces or regions, or three-dimensional volumes. Aside from maps, these types of datasets frequently appear in the physical sciences, but less so in the social sciences.

## Attribute types

**Attribute types** (or **variable types**) define the different types of data encoded in attributes, and will generally be important to determining how to visually depict these attributes.

## Semantics

**Semantics** define the real-world meaning of data. Data **type** defines its structural or mathematical interpretation. For instance, numbers are stored in R as **integer** or **doubles**. That is the data's type. However these numbers can have any number of semantic meanings. Are they days of the month? A person's age? A zip code?

A **key** attribute acts as an index that is used to look up the **value** attributes, so the key must uniquely identify each item. Sometimes a single attribute acts as the key, whereas in higher-dimensional data multiple attributes in combination form the key attributes. In the most basic table, the row number acts as the key attribute.

> Munzner defines key attributes as **independent variables**, while value attributes are **dependent variables**. I don't particularly like this definition because depending on the research question, an attribute may serve as a dependent variable or as an independent variable (in statistical terms).
